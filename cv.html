        <p id = "about_me_text"> 
            Born in Manhuaçu, Minas Gerais, Brazil, from an early age 
            I was passionate about the search for knowledge. As a 
            primary and secondary school student, I enrolled at 
            Colégio Losango - Manhuaçu, where I delved deeper into 
            natural sciences, discovering my predilection for them. 
            While still at school, I participated in Scientific Olympiads, 
            through which I entered university, which was the beginning
            of my academic career. I am currently enrolled in Information 
            Systems at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG),
            however, I was enrolled in Physics at the State University 
            of Campinas (Unicamp) for two years. Furthermore, I
            participated in the UNIGOU Remote Program at the University of
            Hradec Králové, carrying out academic collaboration in Computer
            Science at that university, having researchead Artificial
            Intelligence at the Faculty of Informatics and Management, 
            Department of Information Technologies. I also carried out other 
            external scientific activities, such as an internship at CNPEM 
            (National Center for Research in Energy and Materials), where I 
            studied Nanotechnology, working on the Sirius electron accelerator,
            and participating in the rocketry team at UNICAMP (ANTARES), working 
            in the Electronics sector. In addition, I have already provided voluntary
            academic tutoring in Applied Physics I to undergraduate students. 
            I also regularly participate in scientific events, both participating 
            in them and presenting work. I have interests and skills in various
            programming languages (C, C++, Python, Julia), Data Science,
            Artificial Intelligence and Software Development in such areas.

            <p>
                2022-2023: Internship at <b>CNPEM (National Center for Energy and Materials Research)</b>: 
                Design and fabrication of nanostructures for analysis via <em>s-SNOM</em> in the infrared
                and terahertz ranges. Summary: In this project, a detailed experimental study 
                will be carried out on the fabrication and subsequent <em>s-SNOM</em> characterization 
                of 2D heterostructures based on lamellar materials (h-BN, MoO3 and Talc) as well 
                as their lithography in the form of resonators. The fabrication and assembly 
                of the nanostructures will be carried out in the Two-Dimensional Materials Laboratory 
                (L2D) in tune with the <em>s-SNOM</em> instrumentation in operation on <b>Sirius's IMBUIA</b> line. 
                Eventually, more sophisticated structures will be produced via nano thinning by 
                "Focused Ion Beam" (FIB) at the <b>Micrometric Samples Laboratory (LAM)</b> at the
            <b>National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS)</b>.

                2024-2024: Academic Collaboration at <b>University of Hradec Králové</b>: Identification and Mitigation of
                Threats and Vulnerabilities of Modern Machine Learning Systems. Summary: The work will examine various
                aspects of the harmful potential of artificial intelligence, that is, the approaches and procedures 
                of artificial intelligence that can be the cause of attacks, and the possibilities of prevention and 
                defence against them. Many of the possible approaches to prevent and defend against vulnerabilities 
                from malicious AI applications must also be based on AI approaches and practices. The research will 
                therefore be focused on both the aforementioned aspects of artificial intelligence applications and on
                solving typical problems of vulnerabilities in artificial intelligence systems.
